# Z80 Assembler


This is a Zilog Z80 assembler.

I've already written a Z80 assembler in Python which is available in my
[z80 repository](https://github.com/adzierzanowski/z80/). The difference is that
`zasm` is a 2-pass asm whereas the python one passed the source several times and
is significantly slower.

**This is a work in progress.**

## TODO

* find a little hanging memleak
